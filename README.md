# Analyzing-Baseball-Data-R-SQL-

In this project, I use R to access a baseball database(lahman2013.sqlite) and answer baseball related questions. Before utilizing R, this project's goal is to use as much SQL as possible to generate an answer or dataframe. I wrote the SQL code in R character strings and formatted them for readability and interpretability.
